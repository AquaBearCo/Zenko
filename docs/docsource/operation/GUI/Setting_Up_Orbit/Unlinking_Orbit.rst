Unlinking Orbit from XDM
==========================

During product familiarization and solution development, it may be necessary
to unlink a XDM instance from Orbit. To do this:

#. Click the **Settings** button in the sidebar.

Orbit's association with the XDM instance is broken. To connect
Orbit to another XDM instance or reconnect it to the forgotten
instance, follow the steps in :ref:`Setting Up a Full Orbit Installation
<setting_up_orbit>`.
