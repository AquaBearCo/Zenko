Searching Metadata with XDM
=============================

A successful request to XDM requires

-  XDM credentials
-  Auth V4 signature

If these requirements are satisfied, you can perform metadata searches
by

-  Entering a search in the Orbit Search tool from an authorized session.
   See :ref:`Searching Metadata from Orbit`.
-  Using the ``search_bucket`` tool (found in the
   `Scality/S3 <https://github.com/scality/S3>`__ GitHub repository) as
   described in :ref:`Using search_bucket`.
-  Making an Auth V4-signed HTTP request to XDM as described in
   :ref:`HTTP Search Requests`.
